We noticed that we are dealing with big data where we receive a lot data from our sources which is
unstructured(in this case) and of different formats, we intend on building a data system that will
be able to structure and store the data(using technologies like Hadoop) into a data lake and present
a logically structured version of the data.
\newline
The data system will be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  Fault tolerant 
	\item  Cost effective
	\item  Flexible
\end{itemize}

\newline \\
Hadoop is designed to deal with large clusters of data and of any type and all the above points are catered for by Hadoop.
\newline 
The solution we propose will allow any application to interact with our data system and the data system will provide organised information to the application.
\newline \\ \\
This will make the application interacting with our data system able to adhere to the following usability goals:
\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Effectiveness - make the product good at what itâ€™s supposed to do.
    \item Efficiency - help to increase productivity.
    \item Utility - provide the functionality that the users
    want/need.
    \item Learnability - Make it easy for user to learn and use the product.
    \item Intuitive - Make it easy to use and understand the application.
    
\end{enumerate}
