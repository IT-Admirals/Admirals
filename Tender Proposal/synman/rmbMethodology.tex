\textbf{ \large Traditional(Waterfall) software development methodology.}
\newline \\  We intend on using Traditional approach because it entails achieving the succession in the implementation process and provides the benefits of milestone-based planning and team building and it involves the following stages:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Initiation (requirements specification).
        \item Planning and design.
        \item Execution (construction and coding)
        \item Control and integration.
        \item Validation (testing and debugging).
        \item Closure (installation and maintenance).
\end{itemize}
